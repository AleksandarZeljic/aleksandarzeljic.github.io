# Aleksandar Zeljić

## About
I am a computer scientist and a postdoc at Stanford at [Center for Automated
Reasoning at Stanford University](https://centaur.stanford.edu) and [Stanford's
Center for AI Safety](https://aisafety.stanford.edu). I am supervised by Prof.
Clark Barrett. My current work focuses on
[Marabou](https://neuralnetworkverification.github.io/), a tool for deep neural
network verification. My resume can be found [here](azresume.pdf).

I hold a PhD from Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University. My
PhD thesis was on SMT-style reasoning about machine arithmetic
(floating-point and bit-vector arithmetics). I was supervised by Philipp
Ruemmer, Christoph M. Wintersteiger and Wang Yi.

## Research
My research interests include the following:

* **Automated reasoning (SAT, SMT, Theorem proving)**
* **Formal verification and testing**
* **Verification of deep neural networks**

## My Projects:
  - [Marabou](https://github.com/NeuralNetworkVerification/Marabou) - a framework for verification of deep neural networks.
  - [UppSAT](https://github.com/uuverifiers/uppsat) - implements an approximation-based framework for SMT solvers.
  - [mcBV](https://github.com/Microsoft/mcBV) - a model-constructing SMT solver for the theory of quantifier-free fixed-size bit-vectors.
  - [SmallFloats](https://github.com/AleksandarZeljic/z3) - prototype implementation of the approximation framework as a tactic within Z3 SMT solver.
