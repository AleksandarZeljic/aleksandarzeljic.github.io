## About
I am a computer scientist and I hold a PhD from Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University. My research focused on SMT-style reasoning about machine arithmetic (floating-point and bit-vector arithmetics). I was supervised by Philipp Ruemmer, Christoph M. Wintersteiger and Wang Yi. You can find my CV [here](/azcv.pdf).

## Research
My research interests include the following:

* **Automated reasoning (SAT, SMT, Theorem proving)**
* **Formal verification and testing**
* **Machine learning**

## Projects:
  - [UppSAT](https://github.com/uuverifiers/uppsat) - implements an approximation-based framework for SMT solvers.
  - [mcBV](https://github.com/Microsoft/mcBV) - a model-constructing SMT solver for the theory of quantifier-free fixed-size bit-vectors.
  - [SmallFloats](https://github.com/AleksandarZeljic/z3) - prototype implementation of the approximation framework as a tactic within Z3 SMT solver.
